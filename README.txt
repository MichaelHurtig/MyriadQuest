Myriad Mobile Challenge Project. 

Overview:
===============================================================================
This is my submission for the Myriad Quest Challenge. Thank you for letting me
do this project, and while I did not get nearly as far as I wanted, I learned a
lot while working on this quest. 

I spent the first week of the project reviewing Java while I was travelling, 
and was a little unpleasantly surprised at how little that review came into 
play while I was working: I could have easily skipped the review and not hurt
myself at all. 

The second week of the project I spent doing some Android programming examples
and tutorials, reading a Android programming text and having a glorious time 
completely borking my Android Studio install, then mis-configuring the VCS, and
creating several impressive errors in my example code that took a while to 
figure out. 

Week three was much more productive, as I figured out more of the Android 
library, and how Android programs are put together. Honestly, now that I have a 
better understanding of what is going on, I think I am going to keep working on 
this project and see what I can accomplish. 

Again, thank you for letting me do this challenge, and I hope to hear from you 
soon.
